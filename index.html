                    <h3>Golf Sales Lead</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a seasoned sales professional with over two years of experience 
                        at Dick's Sporting Goods in Liberty, MO, I have honed my skills in 
                        building strong relationships with customers and driving exceptional 
                        sales performance. In my role as a Golf Sales Lead and Certified 
                        Master Club Fitter, I specialize in understanding the unique needs 
                        of golfers and providing tailored solutions that enhance their game 
                        and satisfaction.
                        <br>
                        Starting as a base-level associate, I quickly advanced to the role
                        of Golf Sales Lead, where I transformed our department from one of the 
                        lowest performing in the district to consistently ranking among the top. 
                        My department's sales performance now competes with and often exceeds 
                        those of much larger departments. This success is a testament to my 
                        strategic approach, dedication to customer service, and deep knowledge 
                        of the golf industry.

           <div class="about-me__body">
               <p>I am a proud graduate of Park University with a degree in Computer Science.
                  While my academic journey provided me with a strong technical foundation,
                  I discovered that my true passion lies in sales. This career path aligns 
                  with my interests and allows me to leverage my competitive spirit and hardworking nature.
                <br>
                  Outside of work and studies, you will find me on the golf course, playing or 
                  practicing with a scratch handicap. Golf has instilled in me discipline, focus,
                  and perseveranceâ€”qualities I bring to my sales career. At Dick's Sporting Goods, 
                  I advanced from a base-level associate to Golf Sales Lead and Certified Master 
                  Club Fitter, transforming my department into one of the top performers in our district.
                <br>
                  My sales journey started with a love for golf and a desire to help others enhance 
                  their game. This passion, combined with my technical background, allows me to provide 
                  unique insights and solutions to clients. Before studying computer science, I taught 
                  myself basic coding and how to build websites (such as this one), demonstrating my
                  self-starting attitude and ability to tackle challenges.
                <br>
                  I am eager to continue my career in sales, where I can combine my technical knowledge, 
                  competitive nature, and passion for helping others to drive success.</p>
